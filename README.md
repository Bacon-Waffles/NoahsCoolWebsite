# NoahsCoolWebsite
The magical website of mine.

What to do:
OPEN UP HOMEPAGE.HTML FIRST!!!!

Also, avoid the quiz page because that's broken and only uploaded because it was the first webpage I made.

Ok, if the Hexadecimal page menus glitch out, reload the page BY CLICKING ON IT IN THE HEADER!


Next, if the Galapagos Captions does not immediately have an image, reload the page. Sometimes it doesn't show up, but othertimes it does.
