# NoahsCoolWebsite
The magical website of mine.
Made for Fairview Web Team by Noah Finer

What to do:
OPEN UP HOMEPAGE.HTML FIRST!!!!

Also, avoid the quiz page because that's broken and only uploaded because it was the first webpage I made.

Ok, if the Hexadecimal page menus glitch out, reload the page BY CLICKING ON IT IN THE HEADER!

Next, if the Galapagos Captions does not immediately have an image, reload the page. Sometimes it doesn't show up, but othertimes it does. Also, that page used to have music but I had to remove it in case of copyright.

Finally, XCode really hates jQuery and formatted it REALLY WEIRDLY so all the indents are messed up in script.js. If you decide to read it, just pretend those indentations are normal.
